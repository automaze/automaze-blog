Hi, welcome to my blog,

this is my little place on the Internet where I can share my experiences and thoughts on all things IT-related.

I deliver professional IT services, ranging from writing functional and technical designs to implementing and troubleshooting virtual infrastructures. 

Working with products from Citrix, VMware, Microsoft, Ivanti and Liquidware i can design and maintain various IT environments ranging from virtual desktops to application and (automated) os deployments in the cloud and on-premises.

Kind regards,  
Brian
